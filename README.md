# Acd_Tools
Simple tools for my research

These are just very very very simple tools for doing my research, especially for me to parse and analyse linguistic (philological) corpus data.

Those in the master branch are older ones developed with python 2.7, and those in the dev branch are newer ones developed with python 3.6 and have more functions. I will try to merge them someday.

All comments and suggestions are welcome!
