# Acd_Tools
Simple tools for my research

These are just very very very simple tools for doing my research, especially for me to parse and analyse linguistic (philological) corpus data.

Those in the master branch are older ones developed with python 2.7, and those in the dev branch are newer ones mostly developed with python 3.6 and have more functions. I will add new and exciting things in the dev branch instead of the master, and try to merge them someday.

The "03Analyse_word" is used to analyse in a given text, how many times a character appears, and every time when this character appear, what are the characters before it and after it.

The "04Look_up_classical_phonology" is used to look up the classical pronunciation of a character in a specially-designed database (in the form of a plain csv text). It can even read a text, and give the classical pronunciations of all the characters in that text in the form of a csv text. It can also help check whether there are characters of the same pronunciation in one sentence, and what are they. Those in this folder are developed with python 2.7 in dev branch, so you can find `decode` and `encode` every where...

The "05CompareStrings1" is used to compare the contents of two texts. I use the LD algorithm (Levenshtein Distance) which I learn directly from Wangcangyishu 万仓一黍 on cnblogs to help make it. 

All comments and suggestions are welcome!
